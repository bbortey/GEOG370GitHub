    <h1>Homework 2</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Map Projections Description</h2>
    <p>After I inserted the given shapefile, I enabled Indicatrix mapper. Following this, I modified the CRS and selected the intended projection. For aesthetic purposes, I changed the properties of the two layers to create a consistent color theme. After this, I would create a new print layout and add the newly created projection. I added the name of the projection and the ESPG by using the text features. When the print layout was satisfactory, I exported the file as a PNG. I went through several iterations of this process by going back to the original project and just switching the selected projection. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection maintains area close to the Equator, but it distorts area as you gradually move away from the Equator. This is particularly prominent at the North Pole and South Pole. </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The projection takes on the figure of an ellipse. It features curved graticules that are shorter closer to the poles. Similarly, area is more distorted towards these poles. </h3>

    <h2>WGS84/Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <h3>This projection has a more vertical presentation. It preserves shape, but at the cost of area (especially at the South Pole). Distortions in area are pronounced as you move away from the Equator. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Winkel offers a somewhat cylindrical shape. Unlike the Aitoff projection, the graticules are straight. Its most striking distortions occur at the poles. </h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This projection looks stretched out, which accentuates countries that run east-west. The shape is severely distorted (almost elliptical) as you move away from the Equator. There doesn’t appear to be a significant distortion at the Equator. Preserving area might have impacted distance. </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection fosters the impression that you’re looking down at the Earth. Shape gets more distorted as you move away from the center of the Earth. The graticules are curved. Lastly, this projection can accurately depict distance. </h3>

</a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This orientation of this projection is similar to the previous projection. The centerpiece of this projection is the North Pole. Shape gets progressively more distorted as you move away from that point. The graticules look like concentric circles. </h3>

<h2>Sphere Miller Cylindrical </h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Miller Cylindrical looks like the Mercator projection. Both of them contain linear graticules and maintain area. Once again, the poles have a distorted shape.</h3>

<h2>World Sinusoidal</h2>
    <h3>This projection has linear graticules and makes the poles look somewhat pointed. The Equator isn’t distorted, and shape isn’t as distorted as the World Equidistant Conic.  </h3>
