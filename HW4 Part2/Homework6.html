This highlights how the university has dramatically expanded during its life. In 1971, there were 4,676 students enrolled. Between the time this image was taken and when the building was opened in 1979, the student body population almost doubled. There are now approximately 30,000 students. The university had to establish academic buildings like the Colvard North Building to match the student body’s population growth.  <br/><img src='https://inside.uncc.edu/sites/inside.uncc.edu/files/fields/news_features/detail_image/colvard-building-200px_0.jpg'width='100px'/>";

This development shows how the university has shifted from being somewhat siloed to integrating with the Charlotte metropolitan area. The changes could also be linked to how UNCC has reimagined its parking plans and implemented this as an alternative to driving and parking somewhere on the campus. Lastly, being on the light rail line could also signal the university’s desire to be more sustainable.<br/><img src='https://lightrail.uncc.edu/sites/lightrail.uncc.edu/files/styles/short_frontpage_image/public/fields/short_image_rotator/field_short_image/Main_train_sign_1200x400.jpg?itok=JEFwHSoB'width='100px'/>";
